# AGoncal Fascicle: Java Persistence API

Code of my [Java Persistence API Fascicle]().

Applications are made up of business logic, interaction with other systems, user interfaces etc. and data.
Most of the data that our applications manipulate have to be stored in datastores, retrieved, processed and analysed.
If this datastore is a relational database and you use an object-oriented programming language such as Java, then you should have a look at JPA.
JPA is an Object-Relational Mapping tool that maps Java objects to relational databases and allows query operations.

In this fascicle will you will learn Java Persistence API, its annotations for mapping entities as well as the Java Persistence Query Language and entity life cycle and a few advanced topics such as integrating JPA with other frameworks (Bean Validation, JTA, CDI, Spring).
